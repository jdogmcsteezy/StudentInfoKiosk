# StudentInfoKiosk
    The motivation for this project was to create a dashboard (sideways tv) in which students could find relevant and current information for a specific building on the Butte College campus. We wanted to display information such as time and date, weather, academic deadlines, and the day's scheduled classes. To simplify development each window was created as an individual widget (object) which was then stitched together in pyShell.py to make a final program.

# Acknowledgments
    This project was done with the support of a group. The group met mostly to talk about design and implantation, however almost all the code was written by me. The reason I say this is because the history of commits to this repo show two other contributers who helped stitch the code together but did not write the bulk of the code. I will say that the group provided enthusiasm that really motivated me to keep working on the project.
